# Intellingo
In the context of the SCATE research project at Hasselt University, we are exploring alternative interfaces for translation software. More information about the project can be found on the website of [KU Leuven](https://www.arts.kuleuven.be/ling/ccl/projects/scate).

The team at Hasselt University focused on intelligibility to help translators understand how automatically generated suggestions might be useful to them. Our full CHI 2018 paper is available at [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3173574.3174098).
